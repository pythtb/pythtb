How to test code 
================

Install tox package by running "pip install tox" in command prompt.

Go into src folder and type "tox".

You will need to have tox installed and tox.ini file may need to point to 
binaries of python you wish to use in the test.  Note that tox does NOT work
with anaconda version of python at this point (Dec 2016).

=========================
If you enounter an error like
  ------------------------------------------------------
  ERROR: Error in "xxx" directive: invalid option block.
  ------------------------------------------------------
Then (a) leave a blank line between the directive and text block,
and/or (b) make sure no line in text block starts with a colon
by rewrapping the text in some way.
(This seems to be a problem that occurs for my version of Docutils
but not Sinisa's...)
