We will use  gitflow workflow as described here

https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow

*************************

Here are steps that Sinisa did once and they don't need to be done
again.

1. Sinisa created private github repository.

2. Sinisa shared private github repository with David through github
website.

3. Sinisa created develop branch and pushed it to github using the
following

  git branch develop
  git push -u origin develop

Note that "origin" in git language means github repository.

*************************

1. If say David wants to add a feature to pythtb he should first get
repositoty:

  git clone http://github.com/sinisacoh/pythtb

2. Then David should change to the develop branch.  First you make
sure to go to the master and then to the develop branch:

  cd pythtb
  git checkout master
  git checkout develop

3. Next David should make a feature branch for the addition he wants
to do to the code

  git checkout -b feature_DESCRIPTOR

4. Now David can do whatever work he wants to do on this branch.  Say,
to add a file,

  git add FILENAME

or to submit changes to the feature branch

  git commit -m "type message here"
  git push

5. When David is done with working on the feature branch, he should
merge it into develop.

  git checkout develop
  git merge feature_DESCRIPTOR

**************************

When we are ready to have a new version of python, we should merge
develop branch with the master as well as erase the feature branch.

git checkout master
git merge develop
git branch -d feature_DESCRIPTOR
