If you are unfamiliar with Python or are not sure whether Python and
the necessary modules are installed on your system, see our
:doc:`python introduction <../resources>` 
and :doc:`installation instructions <../install>`.

You can download each example script below individually by clicking on
the 'Source code' link under each example.

Note that there is also a useful `collection of PythTB sample programs
<https://minisites.cambridgecore.org/berryphases/ptb_samples.html>`_ that
were developed in connection with David Vanderbilt's book `Berry Phases in
Electronic Structure Theory <https:/www.cambridge.org/9781107157651>`_
(Cambridge University Press, 2018).
