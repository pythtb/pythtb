Buckling examples
=================
The following examples illustrate the use of PythTB for
tight-binding models with non-planar geometries.

.. _trestle-example:

Trestle
-------

Simple model with one-dimensional k-space, two-dimensional r-space,
and with complex hoppings.

.. _buckled_layer:

Buckled layer
-------------

This is a very simple illustration of a slab geometry in which
the orbitals are specified in a 3D space, but the system is only
extensive in 2D, so that k-space is only 2D.
