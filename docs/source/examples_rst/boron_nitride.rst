BN ribbon with change of nonperiodic vector
-------------------------------------------

This boron nitride ribbon calculation illustrates a case where
it is a good idea to change a nonperiodic lattice vector to be
normal to the periodic direction(s).  While the model is
physically the same before and after the change, as shown by the
identical band structures, the Berry phase is consistent with
the polarization in the extended direction only after the change.
