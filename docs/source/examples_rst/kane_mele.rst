Kane-Mele Examples
===================
This section provides examples of using the Kane-Mele model
features in PythTB. The Kane-Mele model is a two-dimensional
topological insulator that exhibits spin-orbit coupling and
non-trivial topological properties. The examples demonstrate
how to define the model, compute its band structure, and analyze
the topological invariants such as the :math:`Z_2` invariant.

Kane-Mele model using spinor features
-------------------------------------

Calculate the band structure of the Kane-Mele model, illustrating
the use of spinor features of the code.  Also compute the 1D
Wannier centers along :math:`x` as a function of :math:`k_y`,
illustrating the determination of the :math:`Z_2` invariant.
