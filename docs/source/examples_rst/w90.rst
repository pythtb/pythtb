Wannier90 Examples
==================
Here you can find examples of how to use the `PythTB` interface with `Wannier90 <http://www.wannier.org>`_.
These examples illustrate how to read Wannier90 output, manipulate the tight-binding model, and visualize
the results.

Quick Wannier90 example
-----------------------

To run the interface with Wannier90, you must first download the
following :download:`wannier90 output example <../misc/wannier90_example.tar.gz>` 
and unpack it with the following command in unix command

.. code-block:: bash

        tar -zxf wannier90_example.tar.gz

The example below will read the tight-binding model from the Wannier90
calculation, create a simplified model in which some small hopping
terms are ignored, and finally plot the interpolated band structure.

   :include-source:

.. _w90_long:

Longer Wannier90 example
------------------------

This is a somewhat longer example showing how to use the interface to
Wannier90.  Unlike the example above, this one includes some
diagnostics as well.

To run the interface with Wannier90, first download
:download:`wannier90 output example <../misc/wannier90_example.tar.gz>`
and unpack it with the following command in unix command::

        tar -zxf wannier90_example.tar.gz

Here is the source code of the example.
