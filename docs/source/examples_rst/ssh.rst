SSH Model Examples
=================
Below is an example demonstrating how to define a simple one-dimensional SSH model.
This example includes the source code and a plot of the resulting band structure.

SSH model
---------

This is a simple one-dimensional SSH model. The code plots the band structure as
a function of the intracell hopping parameter. The right panel shows the path of the vector
defining the Hamiltonian.
