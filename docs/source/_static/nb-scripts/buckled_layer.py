# # Slab geometry
# 
# This is a simple illustration of a slab geometry in which
# the orbitals are specified in a 3D space, but the system is only
# extensive in 2D, so that k-space is only 2D.

# define 3D real-space lattice vectors
lat = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 1.25, 0], [0, 0, 3]]
# define coordinates of orbitals in reduced units
orb = [[0, 0, -0.15], [0.5, 0.5, 0.15]]

# ## Band structure calculation

# Now we specify the k-space path for the band structure calculation by listing a set of nodes. The path will consist of straight line segments connecting these nodes.

# In[5]:


path = [[0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.5], [0.5, 0.5], [0.0, 0.0]]
# specify labels for these nodal points
label = (r"$\Gamma $", r"$X$", r"$M$", r"$\Gamma $")


# ### `TBModel.plot_bands`
# 
# We can find the bands in two different ways. First we will use the `TBModel.plot_bands` method to visualize the band structure.
# This is useful for quickly assessing the overall shape of the band structure and identifying key features such as band gaps and degeneracies.

# In[6]:


my_model.plot_bands(path, k_label=label)


# ### `TBModel.solve_ham`
# 
# Alternatively, we can use the `TBModel.solve_ham` method to compute the band structure directly. This method requires the k-points to be specified as input. To generate the k-points, we can use the `TBModel.k_path` method to construct the path through k-space, passing the desired path and the number of k-points as arguments. The `k_path` method will return the k-vectors, the distances along the path, and the original node positions.

# In[ ]:


(k_vec, k_dist, k_node) = my_model.k_path(path, 81)


# Now we can call the `TBModel.solve_ham` method with the k-vectors obtained from `k_path` to compute the band structure.

# In[8]:


evals = my_model.solve_ham(k_vec)


# In[9]:


fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.set_title("Bandstructure for buckled rectangular layer")
ax.set_ylabel("Band energy")

# specify horizontal axis details
ax.set_xlim(k_node[0], k_node[-1])
# put tickmarks and labels at node positions
ax.set_xticks(k_node)
ax.set_xticklabels(label)
# add vertical lines at node positions
for n in range(len(k_node)):
    ax.axvline(x=k_node[n], linewidth=0.5, color="k")

ax.plot(k_dist, evals)
