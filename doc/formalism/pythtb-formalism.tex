\section{Introduction}
%==================================================================

The empirical tight-binding (TB) method is a useful tool for
constructing and solving simple models of the electronic structure
of solid-state systems.  Essentially, one parametrizes the
Hamiltonian matrix elements connecting localized atomic-like basis orbitals,
and uses this to compute the band energies and Bloch eigenvectors.
Such TB models can, for example, give a highly informative first-order
picture of the electronic structure of the CuO planes in a
high-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductor, or of the $\pi$ bands in
graphene or carbon nanotubes.  For basic references about the
TB approach, see the Wikipedia article~\cite{wiki-tb},
the text by Harrison~\cite{harrison-book},
or almost any standard solid-state physics text.

With the strong development of interest in topological insulators
after about 2005, TB models have again played a central role as
model systems.  Examples include the models of Haldane~\cite{haldane},
Kane and Mele~\cite{km}, and Fu, Kane and Mele~\cite{fkm}.
In connection with the topological properties, it also becomes
crucial to be able to calculate, within the context of the
TB model, various quantities that are related in some way to
Berry phases or curvatures, including electric polarization,
orbital magnetization, anomalous Hall conductivity, Chern
indices, the effects of adiabatic cycling of the Hamiltonian,
and the like.  The definitions of these quantities and practical
methods for calculating them are discussed in several review
articles~\cite{resta-rmp,vand-resta,xcn,resta-jpcm} and
a relevant Wikipedia page~\cite{wiki-berry}.

The \PythTB\ package (http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/pythtb)
is an open-source software package, written in
the Python programming/scripting language, that
allows for the construction and solution of simple TB models
such as those mentioned above.  Moreover, it includes tools
for calculating many of the Berry-phase related quantities mentioned
above.  As such, it can be used as a research tool for determining
the behavior of model systems, or as a pedagogical tool at the
level of a graduate or upper-level undergraduate solid-state
physics course.

The present notes outline the TB formalism as it pertains to the
\PythTB\ package, providing needed definitions and basic results.
In keeping with the capabilities of the \PythTB\ package, we restrict
ourselves here to the \textit{orthogonal tight binding} approach, in which
the TB basis orbitals are assumed to be orthonormal.  We also
emphasize that the code is not currently set up to handle realistic
chemical interactions. So for example, the Slater-Koster
forms~\cite{wiki-tb-me} for interactions between $s$, $p$ and $d$
orbitals are not currently coded, although the addition of such
features could be considered for a future release.

%==================================================================
\section{Basic definitions}
%==================================================================

For the case of a 3D crystal, the lattice vectors are
%
\beq
\R=n_1\a_1+n_2\a_2+n_3\a_3
\eeq
%
and the corresponding reciprocal lattice vectors are
%
\beq
\G=m_1\b_1+m_2\b_2+m_3\b_3
\eeq
%
where $n_i$ and $m_i$ are integers, and the primitive real
and reciprocal lattice vectors obey
%
\beq
\a_i\cdot\b_j=2\pi\,\delta_{ij} \;.
\eeq
%
It follows that
%
\beq
e^{i\G\cdot\R}=1
\label{eq:ide}
\eeq
%
for any pair of real and reciprocal lattice vectors.
A wavevector $\k$ in the Brillouin zone (BZ) can be written either in
Cartesian coordinates, $\k=k_x\hat{x}+k_y\hat{y}+k_z\hat{z}$, or
in internal coordinates, $\k=k_1\b_1+\k_2\b_2+\k_3\b_3$.

The generalization to $d$ dimensions is obvious.  (The \PythTB\ code
also handles the case of $d$=0, corresponding to an isolated molecule,
cluster, or finite sample.)

Let $\mu$ label the atoms in the primitive cell and $\alpha$ label the
orbitals on a given atom, and let the TB basis orbitals
be $\varphi_{\mu\alpha}(\r-\R-\t_\mu)$ where $\t_\mu$ is the location of
atom $\mu$ in the home unit cell.  Note that it
is possible for $\r$ and $\t$ to live in a higher-dimensional
space than $\R$ and $\k$.  For example, $\R$ and $\k$ would be
one-dimensional for a polymer, and they would be two-dimensional
for an infinite slab of finite thickness, while  $\r$ and $\t$
would remain three-dimensional in both cases.

We now introduce a compound index $j=\{\mu\alpha\}$ that runs over
all the $L$ TB orbitals in the primitive cell, and define
%
\beq
\phi_{\R j}(\r)=\phi_j(\r-\R)=\varphi_{\mu\alpha}(\r-\R-\t_\mu)
\eeq
%
to be the TB basis orbital of type $j$ in cell $\R$.
From now on we drop indices ${\mu\alpha}$ and work only with $j$,
letting $\t_\mu\rightarrow \t_j$.

We now restrict ourselves to a \textit{minimal TB model} having the
property that the basis orbitals are orthonormal,
%
\beq
\ip{\phi_{\R i}}{\phi_{\R' j}}=\delta_{\R\R'}\,\delta_{ij}
\label{eq:ortho}
\eeq
%
and that the position matrix have the simplest possible form,
%
\beq
\me{\phi_{\R i}}{\r}{\phi_{\R' j}}=(\R+\t_j)\,\delta_{\R\R'}\,\delta_{ij} \;.
\label{eq:posit}
\eeq
%
The Hamiltonian is assumed to have translational symmetry, so that its
matrix elements are defined via
%
\beq
H_{ij}(\R)=\me{\phi_{\R'i}}{H}{\phi_{\R'+\R,j}} 
          =\me{\phi_{\0 i}}{H}{\phi_{\R,j}}
\label{eq:ham}
\eeq
%
and we assume that $H_{ij}(\R)$ decays rapidly with increasing $\R$.

%==================================================================
\section{Transition to the Bloch representation}
%==================================================================

%------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Convention I}
%------------------------------------------------------------------

We construct Bloch-like basis functions
%
\beq
\chi^\k_j(\r)=\sum_\R e^{i\k\cdot(\R+\t_j)}\,\phi_j(\r-\R)
\eeq
%
which we write henceforth in a bra-ket language as
%
\beq
\ket{\chi^\k_j}=\sum_\R e^{i\k\cdot(\R+\t_j)}\,\ket{\phi_{\R j}}
\eeq
%
with the understanding that the normalization is to a single
unit cell, i.e.,
%
\beq
\ip{\chi}{\chi'} \equiv \int_\textrm{cell} d^3r\,\chi^*(\r) \,\chi'(\r)\;.
\eeq
%
It follows from \equ{ortho} that
%
\beq
\ip{\chi^\k_i}{\chi^{\k}_j}=\delta_{ij} \;.
\eeq
%
The Bloch eigenstates are then expanded as
%
\beq
\ket{\psi_{n\k}} = \sum_j C_j^{n\k} \, \ket{\chi^\k_j}
\eeq
%
and the Hamiltonian matrix is constructed as
%
\beq
H_{ij}^\k = \me{\chi_i^\k}{H}{\chi_j^\k}
=\sum_\R e^{i\k\cdot(\R+\t_j-\t_i)}\,H_{ij}(\R) \;.
\label{eq:Hk}
\eeq
%
The secular equation to be solved is
%
\beq
{\cal H}_\k\cdot {\cal C}_{n\k} = E_{n\k}\,{\cal C}_{n\k}
\eeq
%
where ${\cal H}_\k$ is the $L\times L$ matrix of elements
$H_{ij}^\k$ and ${\cal C}_{n\k}$ is the column vector of
elements $C_j^{n\k}$.

This secular equation can be straightforwardly diagonalized to
give the TB solution for the energy eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
Of course, this TB solution only produces $L$ bands, where $L$ is
the number of TB basis orbitals per cell, representing an approximation
to the $L$ bands of the crystal that are built from these TB
orbitals (usually these are the $L$ lowest valence and
conduction bands).

%------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Convention II}
%------------------------------------------------------------------

In this convention the phase factor $e^{i\k\cdot\t_j}$ is not
included in the definition of the Bloch-like basis functions.  Using
tilde'd quantities to denote objects defined in Convention II, we
get
%
\beq
\ket{\chit^\k_j}=\sum_\R e^{i\k\cdot\R}\,\ket{\phi_{\R j}} \;,
\eeq
%
\beq
\ket{\psi_{n\k}} = \sum_j \Ct_j^{n\k} \, \ket{\chit^\k_j} \;,
\eeq
%
\beq
\Ht_{ij}^\k = \me{\chit_i^\k}{H}{\chit_j^\k}
=\sum_\R e^{i\k\cdot\R}\,H_{ij}(\R) \;.
\eeq
%
\beq
\cHt_\k\cdot \cCt_{n\k} = E_{n\k}\,\cCt_{n\k} \;.
\eeq

%------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Relationship between the two conventions}
\label{sec:rel}
%------------------------------------------------------------------

The quantities in the two conventions are related via
%
\beq
\Ht_{ij}^\k=e^{i\k\cdot(\t_i-\t_j)}\,H_{ij}^\k
\eeq
%
and
\beq
\Ct_j^{n\k}=e^{i\k\cdot\t_j}\,C_j^{n\k} \;.
\eeq
%
The two conventions are essentially just related by a unitary
rotation in the $L$-dimensional space.

When reading the literature, it is a good idea to be careful to
determine which convention the authors are using.  Convention II
is probably the more common one, because the extra factors of
$e^{i\k\cdot\t_j}$ can be ignored.  However, Convention I is in
many ways more natural, especially in connection with the calculation
of electric polarization and related Berry-phase quantities, and
is the convention adopted in the \PythTB\ code.

One way of seeing this is to draw an analogy between the
Bloch function $\psi_{n\k}(\r)$ and
$\Ct_j^{n\k}$, and between the cell-periodic Bloch function
$u_{n\k}(\r)$ and $C_j^{n\k}$.
Recalling that
%
\beq
\psi_{n\k}(\r)=e^{i\k\cdot\r}u_{n\k}(\r) \;,
\label{eq:Bloch}
\eeq
%
and temporarily adopting the change of notation $C^{n\k}_j
\rightarrow C_{n\k}(j)$ and similarly for $\Ct$, we can write
%
\bea
\ket{\psi_{n\k}}&=&\sum_\R\int_\textrm{cell} d^3r\;\psi_{n\k}(\r)\,
e^{i\k\cdot\R}\,\ket{\R+\r} \;,\nn\\
                &=&\sum_\R\sum_j \Ct_{n\k}(j)\,
e^{i\k\cdot\R}\,\ket{\phi_{\R j}} \;,
\eea
%
while
%
\bea
\ket{\psi_{n\k}}&=&\sum_\R\int_\textrm{cell} d^3r\;u_{n\k}(\r)\,
e^{i\k\cdot(\R+\r)}\,\ket{\R+\r} \;,\nn\\
                &=&\sum_\R\sum_j C_{n\k}(j)\,
e^{i\k\cdot(\R+\t_j)}\,\ket{\phi_{\R j}} \;.
\eea
%
To summarize, then, the analogy is
%
\[
\psi_{n\k}(\r)\;\Leftrightarrow\;\Ct^{n\k}_j
\qquad\textrm{and}\qquad
u_{n\k}(\r)\;\Leftrightarrow\;C^{n\k}_j
\]

As we shall see in Sec.~\ref{sec:berry}, it is the cell-periodic
functions $u_{n\k}(\r)$ that play a central role in the formulation
of Berry-phase quantities such as electric polarization.  It is
largely for this reason that we have adopted Convention I for our
\PythTB\ implementation, and this convention is assumed for the remainder
of these notes.

%------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Spinor models}
\label{sec:spinors}
%------------------------------------------------------------------

Up to this point, the formalism has been written as though for
a TB model for ``spinless electrons.'' However, it is easy to
generalize to the case of spinors by doubling each TB orbital.
That is, we now take the label `$j$' (in, e.g., $C^{n\k}_j$)
be a condensed notation $j=\{\mu\alpha s\}$ for spin $s$ (up or
down along $z$) and orbital $\alpha$ on atom $\mu$, with
$j=1,...,2L$.  The real-space Hamiltonian becomes
$H_{ij,ss'}(\R)=\me{\phi_{0is}}{H}{\phi_{\R js'}}$
and $H_{ij,ss'}^\k$ is constructed from it in analogy
with \equ{Hk}.  From the Bloch solutions, spin densities
%
\beq
n_{i,ss'}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n\k}^\textrm{occ}
(C^{n\k}_{is})^*\, C^{n\k}_{is'}
\eeq
%
can also be constructed, where $N$ is the number of $\k$-points
in the BZ. The particle density $n_i$ is the trace of the
corresponding spin density matrix.

Clearly the Hamiltonian can be regarded as an $L\times L$
matrix of $2\times 2$ blocks.  An alternative notation (either in
real or reciprocal space) is
%
\beq
H_{ij,ss'} = \sum_a h_{ij,a} \sigma_{a,ss'}
\eeq
%
where $a=\{0,1,2,3\}$, $\sigma_0=E$ (the $2\times2$ identity),
and $\sigma_a$ is the Pauli spin matrix for $a\ne0$.
A similar notation can be adopted for spin densities.

The \PythTB\ code package has features to allow the user to define
a spinor TB Hamiltonian and to set spin-independent or spin-dependent
onsite energies and intersite hoppings.  Spin-dependent terms
can be input either as $2\times 2$ matrices or using the $\sum_a
h_{ij,a} \sigma_{a,ss'}$ four-vector notation.

\section{Berry potential, Berry curvature, and Berry phase}
\label{sec:berry}
%==================================================================

In this section we concentrate on establishing the definitions of,
and basic relations among, the various quantities related to
Berry phases.  The reader is referred to the
references~\cite{resta-rmp,vand-resta,xcn,resta-jpcm,wiki-berry}
mentioned in the Introduction for derivations and for explanations
of the physical significance of the various quantities.

In view of the comments in Sec.~\ref{sec:rel}, we now change notation
and write the column vector of coefficients $C^{\n\k}_j$ as a ket
vector $\ket{u_n(\k)}$,
%
\beq
\begin{pmatrix}
C^{\n\k}_1 \cr \vdots \cr C^{\n\k}_d
\end{pmatrix}
\qquad\Rightarrow\qquad
\ket{u_n(\k)}
\label{eq:notat}
\eeq
%
and the corresponding row vector of conjugated
elements as $\bra{u_n(\k)}$.  We also consider that the Bloch
states may be functions of a set of $g$ parameters $\l_1,...,\l_g$
in addition to the $d$ elements of $\k=k_1,...,k_d$.  In fact,
we further generalize the notation so that
$\bL=\{\L_1,...,\L_{d+g}\} = \{k_1,...,k_d,\l_1,...,\l_g\}$.
(In special cases it is possible to have $g=0$, signifying no
external parameters, or to have $d$=0, as for a molecule
subjected to a set of external fields.)
We assume that the state (or band) $n$ remains non-degenerate with neighboring
states (or bands) throughout the relevant region of $\bL$-space.

The Schr\"odinger equation is then
%
\beq
H_\bL\,\ket{u_n(\L)} = E_n(\L)\,\ket{u_n(\L)}
\eeq
%
where $H_\bL=H_\k(\l_1,...,\l_g)$.  In what follows we will
typically drop the explicit argument $\bL$, letting it be
understood that all quantities (including $A$ and $\Omega$ to
be defined shortly) are functions of $\L$ as well.  We also
henceforth adopt the notation that $\pa=\partial/\partial\L_a$.

%------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Single band}
%------------------------------------------------------------------

For a single isolated band $n$ (i.e., one that does not touch a
higher or lower band anywhere in the BZ) we define the Berry connection
%
\beq
A_{n,a}=i\ip{u_n}{\pa u_n} \;,
\eeq
%
and the Berry curvature
%
\bea
\O_{n,ab}&=& \pa A_{n,b}-\pb A_{n,a} \nn
   &=& i\ip{\pa u_n}{\pb u_n}-i\ip{\pb u_n}{\pa u_n}
   = -2\,\Im\ip{\pa u_n}{\pb u_n}\;,
\eea
%
where $a$ and $b$ run over the $(d+g)$-dimensional generalized
parameter space.  A Berry phase $\phi_n$ is associated with the
phase evolution of the $n$'th state over a closed curve $\cC$ in
this space via
%
\beq
\phi_n=\oint_\cC \A_n\cdot d\bL=\oint_\cC  A_{n,a}\,d\L_a \;,
\eeq
%
where an implied sum notation is used on the right side of the
second equality and similarly in other
equations to follow.  If $\cC$ is the boundary of
a surface $S$, then by Stokes's theorem we may also write
%
\beq
\phi_n=\int_\cS \ve_{abc}\,\O_{n,ab}\,dS_c \;.
\label{eq:Oint}
\eeq
%
In the special case that $S$ is a closed surface, the integral
of its Berry curvature is guaranteed to be $2\pi$ times an
integer index knows as the Chern number (or, more precisely,
the ``first Chern index'').  That is,
%
\beq
\oint_\cS \ve_{abc}\,\O_{n,ab}\,dS_c=2\pi c_n
\eeq
%
where $c_n$ is the Chern number.

There is a ${\cal U}(1)$ ``gauge freedom'' in the choice of the
phases of the Bloch functions.  That is, given a manifold
$\ket{u_n(\bL)}$, one can define a physically identical manifold
%
\beq
\ket{\tilde{u}_n(\bL)}=e^{i\beta(\bL)}\,\ket{u_n(\bL)}
\eeq
%
where $\beta(\bL)$ is a smooth and continuous real function of $\bL$.
The Berry potential $A_{n,a}(\bL)$ is gauge-dependent;
the Berry phase $\phi_n$ is gauge-invariant modulo $2\pi$;\footnote{If 
  the loop $\cC$ is continuously contractible to zero in an
  obvious way, then a unique Berry phase can be assigned by
  assuming $\phi_n$ to vanish for the zero-size loop.  This may
  not be possible, however, if the loop surrounds a region
  of degeneracy with neighboring bands, or if it is defined on
  a topologically nontrivial space with uncontractible cycles (see, e.g.,
  Sec.~\ref{sec:periodic}).}
%
and the Berry curvature $\O_{n,ab}(\bL)$ (and therefor the Chern
number $c_n$) is fully gauge-invariant.

%------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Two and three dimensions}
%------------------------------------------------------------------

In two dimensions, it is convenient to treat $\O_n=-2\Im
\ip{\partial_1 u_n}{\partial_2 u_n}$ as a scalar, and the Berry
phase is just $\phi_n=\oint_\cC \O_n\,dS$.

In three dimensions, it is a common practice to use the axial vector
notation for the Berry curvature, i.e.,
%
\beq
\O_{n,a}= \half  \ve_{abc}\,\O_{n,bc} \qquad\Leftrightarrow\qquad
\O_{n,bc} = \ve_{abc} \O_{n,a}
\eeq
%
in which case the Berry phase is just
$\phi_n=\int_\cS \bO_n\cdot\,d\mathbf{S}$.

%------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Multiband case}
%------------------------------------------------------------------

It is often the case that one wants to treat all the $\Nb$ occupied
bands of an insulator as a joint band manifold.  This is sometimes
referred to as the ``non-Abelian'' case, because the formalism
involves $\Nb\times\Nb$ matrices that do not necessarily commute.
We now assume that this group of bands does not touch with those
below or above in energy in the relevant region of $\bL$-space;
assuming the bands of interest are the occupied valence bands of
a crystalline solid, this follows if the crystal is an insulator.
The appropriate generalizations of the above equations are
as follows.
%
\beq
A_{mn,a}=i\ip{u_m}{\pa u_n} \;,
\eeq
%
\bea
\O_{mn,ab} &=& \pa A_{mn,b} - \pb A_{mn,a} -i[A_a,A_b]_{mn} \nn
   &=&  i\ip{\pa u_m}{\pb u_n}-i\ip{\pb u_m}{\pa u_n} \;,
\eea
%
\bea
\phi
&=&\oint_\cC \Tr[A_a]\,d\L_a \label{eq:bp}\\
&=& \int_\cS \ve_{abc}\,\Tr[\O_{ab}]\,dS_c \;.
\eea
%
and
%
\beq
\oint_\cS \ve_{abc}\,\Tr[\O_{ab}]\,dS_c=2\pi c
\eeq
%
where $\Tr$ denotes a trace over an $\Nb\times\Nb$ matrix.

There is now a ${\cal U}(\Nb)$ gauge freedom in the choice of the
Bloch functions.  That is, given a manifold
$\ket{u_m(\L)}$, one can define a physically identical manifold
%
\beq
\ket{\tilde{u}_n(\bL)}=\sum_m U_{mn}(\bL)\,\ket{u_m(\bL)}
\eeq
%
where $U_{mn}(\bL)$ is an $\Nb\times\Nb$ unitary matrix that
depends smoothly and continuously on $\bL$.
The Berry potential $A_{mn,a}(\bL)$ is gauge-dependent;
the Berry phase $\phi$ is gauge-invariant modulo $2\pi$;
the Berry curvature $\O_{mn,ab}(\bL)$ is gauge-covariant;
and its trace, and therefore the Chern number $c$, are fully
gauge-invariant.

%------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Periodic gauge in $\k$-space and cycles in the BZ}
\label{sec:periodic}
%------------------------------------------------------------------

The Bloch solutions $\psi_{n,\k+\G}(\r)$ and $\psi_{n,\k}(\r)$
represent the same physical state, since they obey the same
Schr\"odinger equation and the same boundary conditions
$\psi_{n,\k}(\r+\R)=e^{i\k\cdot\r}\,\psi_{n,\k}(\r)$,
as follows from \equ{ide}.  It follows that $\psi_{n,\k+\G}(\r)$
and $\psi_{n,\k}(\r)$ can differ only by a phase.  By convention,
we normally take them to be exactly equal,
%
\beq
\psi_{n,\k+\G}(\r)=\psi_{n,\k}(\r) \;,
\label{eq:pergauge}
\eeq
%
a conditions that is
knows as the ``periodic gauge'' condition.  It then follows from
\equ{Bloch} that
%
\beq
u_{n,\k+\G}(\r)=e^{-i\G\cdot\r}\,u_{n\k}(\r)
\label{eq:pergaugeu}
\eeq
%
Reversing the notation of \equ{notat} back into the explicit TB
language, this means that
%
\beq
C^{n,\k+\G}_j=e^{-i\G\cdot\t_j}\,C^{n\k}_j \;.
\label{eq:pergaugeC}
\eeq

Because of this periodicity, the BZ in $d$ dimensional $\k$-space
can be regarded as a $d$-torus.
We are often interested in calculating the Berry phase
as we go around a loop in $\k$-space that cycles around the
torus.  For example, the component of the electric polarization
in the direction of primitive lattice vector $\a_j$ is computed
by considering cycles in which $\k \rightarrow \k+\b_j$ from
beginning to end.  When closing the loop and identifying
$\k$ with $\k+\b_j$, it is important to remember to use
\equ{pergaugeC}.  The Berry phase associated with the electric
polarization has an intrinsic ambiguity modulo $2\pi$, since
the loop on which it is defined is not contractible to zero.

%------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Discretized formulas for Berry quantities}
%------------------------------------------------------------------

Practical calculations are done on a mesh of $\k$-points or
parameter values.  For example, to compute the Berry phase
associated with a given loop in $\bL$-space, the loop $\cC$ is
discretized into a large number of closely spaced points
$\bL_i$, and the integrand of \equ{bp} is approximated
by the discretized formula for the (traced) Berry connection
%
\beq
\Tr[\A]\cdot\Delta\bL = -\Im\ln\det M^{(\bL_i,\bL_{i+1})}
\eeq
%
where $M$ is a $\Nb\times\Nb$ matrix defined as
%
\beq
M_{mn}^{(\bL_i,\bL_{i+1})} = \ip{u_m^{(\bL_i)}}{u_n^{(\bL_{i+1})}}
\eeq
%
and $\Delta\bL=\bL_{i+1}-\bL_i$.
The expression for the Berry phase then becomes

The discretized approximation to the local Berry curvature is
obtained by considering a loop around a small plaquette with
vertices $\bL_i$, computing the Berry phase around this loop as
above, and dividing by the area of the plaquette.
